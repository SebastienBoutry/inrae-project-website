This is a Quarto website.
To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

Creating a French and English website is possible, but requires some special handling. First, you'll need to create _quarto-langue.yml for each language and a master _quarto.yml.

Then, in the web pages, specify the language via 

```
::: {.content-visible when-profile="english"}
the required text
:::
```
## Logo 

### Institut's logo and Laboratory's logo

The institute and laboratory logos must be placed in the image directory, and the path must be entered in the _quarto.yml file.
The institute logo is a hyperlink. When we click on it, the institute web page opens.

### Project's logo

If you have a project's logo, insert the image file (.png or .jpg) in the image directory. If you don't have a project's logo, simply comment out the margin-header part in YAML (Ctrl+C).

## Insert bibliography

Bibliography citations are inserted using a bibliography in bibtex format. We need to amend the bibliography.bib file in bibtex format to cite the references in our page, using ```[@reference]``` .

Example :
Use package InraeTheme [@Carayon_2024]

## Creating web pages

In the terminal, we send the following commands to generate web pages for the different languages.

First run with _quarto-english.yml
```
output-dir: ./public/en
navbar
  - href: ../en
```

```
quarto render --profile english
quarto render --profile francais
```
In a second step, modify the quarto_english.yml output-dir: ./public/en to output-dir: ./public and in the navbar - href: ../en to - href: ./

Second run with _quarto-english.yml
```
output-dir: ./public
navbar
  - href: ./
```
