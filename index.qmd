## Logo 

### Institut's logo and Laboratory's logo

The institute and laboratory logos must be placed in the image directory, and the path must be entered in the _quarto.yml file.
The institute logo is a hyperlink. When we click on it, the institute web page opens.

### Project's logo

If you have a project's logo, insert the image file (.png or .jpg) in the image directory. If you don't have a project's logo, simply comment out the margin-header part in YAML (Ctrl+C).

## Insert bibliography

Bibliography citations are inserted using a bibliography in bibtex format. We need to amend the bibliography.bib file in bibtex format to cite the references in our page, using ```[@reference]``` .
Example :
Use package InraeTheme [@Carayon_2024]

## Creating web pages

In the terminal, we send the following commands to generate web pages.
```
quarto render
```
